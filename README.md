# Number-Plate-Detection

This project leverages the YOLOv8 model for real-time license plate detection. It includes the necessary scripts, configurations, and dependencies to set up and run the detection pipeline efficiently.

# Introduction
The project demonstrates the use of the YOLOv8 model to detect license plates in images and videos. YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a highly efficient object detection framework known for its speed and accuracy.

# Features
Real-time license plate detection.
Easy integration with various datasets.
Includes logging and visualization capabilities for results analysis.
Supports interactive use with Jupyter notebooks.

# Requirements
The project requires the following Python libraries, as specified in requirements.txt:

ultralytics==8.0.3
torch>=1.7.0
torchvision>=0.8.1
matplotlib>=3.2.2
And other dependencies listed in the requirements file.

# Results
The model's performance and detection outputs can be visualized directly within the notebook. Example results include bounding boxes around detected license plates.
